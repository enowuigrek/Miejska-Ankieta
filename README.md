# Miejska Ankieta (Urban Survey)

[Miejska Ankieta Website](http://miejska-ankieta.czest.pl)

## Project Description

"Miejska Ankieta" is a web application based on React, which allows the residents of the city of Częstochowa to answer loose questions that often become a topic of discussion, and sometimes even big disputes ;). The questions can be found in the form of stickers and leaflets in various locations in the city, and residents can answer them by scanning a QR code, and after answering the question, they will be shown a random fun fact about the city and various other topics. Responses to questions are anonymous and are stored in the Firebase database.

The results are shared on social media.

Here are a few example questions, for the rest, you need to take a walk around Częstochowa :)
